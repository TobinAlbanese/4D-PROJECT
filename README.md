## üéØ Vision & Goals

- **Depth & Spatial Reconstruction:** Convert flat images into 3D spatial models with accurate depth mapping.  
- **Temporal Dynamics:** Integrate time-based changes or motion to extend static images into 4D experiences.  
- **Immersive Exploration:** Enable users to navigate and interact with reconstructed scenes in virtual or augmented reality environments.  
- **Multi-Modal Inputs:** Support various image sources including photos, videos, and multi-angle captures for richer reconstructions.  
- **AI-Driven Enhancement:** Use neural networks for super-resolution, scene completion, and temporal interpolation.  
- **Applications:** From surveillance analysis, cultural heritage preservation, to immersive storytelling and education.
